*** could use statictics/summary instead of reports


*** Refactor appTest
    * put mapping process inside function
    * remove dublication of mapping process
    * strings to be printed should be inside variables
        - rather than literally giving it to console.log

*** Refactor inputLib
    * rename variables 
    * is possible filename doesnot belong to inputLib
    * parser function could be a little more clean
    * variable names inside parser is similar and confusing
    * optionsWithHyphen . join . split -> could be better
    * getOptionsWithOutHyphen should be getOptionsWithoutHyphen ? 
    ** use recursion instead of for loop 
    * use a function to put parameters in object
    * rename arrangeOptions to getUniqueOptions?
    * getOptionsWithOutHyphen -> could rename parameter index to fileStartingIndex
    ** can do sort options instead of using 4 ifs
     
*** Refactor lib
    * countingMethods could be better
    * function getDetails, wc could be better
    * should wc call formatOutput ?
    

*** Refactor outputLib
    * name formatOutput could be formatReport
    * variable names allNames, allValues should have better names
    * formatOutput -> while returning dublication could be removed
    * generateTotalReport name could be better
    * generateTotalReport could use better logic and be more consistence
    * onlyCounsts in justifyEachReport could be more readable?
    * getLastIndex doesnot belong in outputLib
    * ----- review every variable name -----
    * make two function, 
        -format single file,
        -format multiple file

******* directory 
    * constants should  have its own filename
    * lib.js, util.js could be renamed to something specific
    


    *************************

callback of fs.readFile 
        * should be called processFileContent?
        * can call { options, filePaths} parsedInputs
