* write external tests
* impliment functioin wordCount to work for default case

* wc behaviour 
    * line - it counts how many new lines, 
        3 lines sepetaed by 2 new line will show count 2
    * word - it counts how many words seperated by space, tab
    * character - counts all the characters

* improvements
    * potential words joining and spliting with spaces
        - if removed then each elements of arrray should be trimmed
    * formatted result should be in different functioin
    * move space trimmer to util.js
